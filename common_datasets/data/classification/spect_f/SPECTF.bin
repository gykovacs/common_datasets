	SPECTF is a good data set for testing ML algorithms; it has 267 instances that are descibed by 45 attributes.
	 Predicted attribute: OVERALL_DIAGNOSIS (binary)
	NOTE: See the SPECT heart data for binary data for the same classification task.

4. Relevant Information:
	The dataset describes diagnosing of cardiac Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images.
	Each of the patients is classified into two categories: normal and abnormal.
	The database of 267 SPECT image sets (patients) was processed to extract features that summarize the original SPECT images.
	As a result, 44 continuous feature pattern was created for each patient.
	The CLIP3 algorithm was used to generate classification rules from these patterns.
	The CLIP3 algorithm generated rules that were 77.0% accurate (as compared with cardilogists' diagnoses).
