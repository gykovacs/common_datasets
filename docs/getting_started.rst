What is ``common_datasets``?
============================

This package provides an unofficial collection of datasets widely used in the evaluation of machine learning
techniques, mainly small and imbalanced datasets for binary, multiclass classification and regression. The
datasets are provided in the usual `sklearn.datasets` format, with missing data imputation and the encoding
of category and ordinal features.
